<h2>About Scuffle</h2>

<div>
    <p>
        Scuffle is a web application that brings friends and family together by making going to the gym a little more motivating.
        As an active gym goer, I myself, sometimes found it difficult to get motivated to go to the gym after a long day at work.
        I found that the only time I was extremely motivated to go to the gym was when I could go with a friend, and we could
        challenge eachother and try to lift more or run longer. This game me the idea of Scuffle, a WebApp that turns working
        out into a game, making it more fun to be active.
